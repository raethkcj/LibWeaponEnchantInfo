# LibWeaponEnchantInfo

A WoW Classic addon for tracking party members' temporary weapon enchantments from shaman totems.

This addon is intended as a backend, providing the duration and icon of party members' weapon enchants for use in other UI addons or WeakAuras. A sample WeakAura implementation can be found here: https://wago.io/RaAkX6ba7
